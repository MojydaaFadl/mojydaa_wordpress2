== Description ==

WP Job Manager is a **lightweight** job listing plugin for adding job board functionality to your WordPress site. Being shortcode based, it can work with any theme (given a bit of CSS styling) and is really simple to setup.

= Features =

* Add, manage, and categorize job listings using the familiar WordPress UI.
* Searchable & filterable ajax powered job listings added to your pages via shortcodes.
* Frontend forms for guests and registered users to submit & manage job listings.
* Allow job listers to preview their listing before it goes live. The preview matches the appearance of a live job listing.
* Each listing can be tied to an email or website address so that job seekers can apply to the jobs.
* Searches also display RSS links to allow job seekers to be alerted to new jobs matching their search.
* Allow logged in employers to view, edit, mark filled, or delete their active job listings.
* Job statistics for employers about job listing views and search impressions.
* Developer friendly code - Custom post types, endpoints & template files.

The plugin comes with several shortcodes to output jobs in various formats, and since its built with Custom Post Types you are free to extend it further through themes.

== Installation ==

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don't even need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install, log in to your WordPress admin panel, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type "WP Job Manager" and click Search Plugins. Once you've found the plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by clicking _Install Now_.

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading the plugin and uploading it to your web server via your favorite FTP application.

* Download the plugin file to your computer and unzip it
* Using an FTP program, or your hosting control panel, upload the unzipped plugin folder to your WordPress installation's `wp-content/plugins/` directory.
* Activate the plugin from the Plugins menu within the WordPress admin.

= Getting started =

Once installed:

1. Create a page called "jobs" and inside place the `[jobs]` shortcode. This will list your jobs.
2. Create a page called "submit job" and inside place the `[submit_job_form]` shortcode if you want front-end submissions.
3. Create a page called "job dashboard" and inside place the `[job_dashboard]` shortcode for logged in users to manage their listings.

**Note when using shortcodes**, if the content looks blown up/spaced out/poorly styled, edit your page and above the visual editor click on the 'text' tab. Then remove any 'pre' or 'code' tags wrapping your shortcode.

For more information, [read the documentation](https://wpjobmanager.com/documentation/).
